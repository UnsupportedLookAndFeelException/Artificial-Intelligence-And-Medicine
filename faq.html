                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Electronic health records are used by most large hospital systems in the US but not in all countries. As part of the HITECH act, there are financial incentives for using EHRs and many clinics are adopting them.</span></div>

                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>A lot of the patient data collected comes from electronic health records. Other patient data can be collected from narrative notes - the text clinicians write about a patient during a visit. Natural language processing is still relatively insophisticated and it will be sometime before narrative notes can be effectively used as a data source. Fitness trackers and other medical wearables also contribute to patient data records. But since they all structure data in different ways, holistically mining data from health trackers is difficult.</span></div>

                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Yes. Hospitals that use predictive analytics generally do stratify populations into groups based on age, quality of life, and many other factors. Developing predictive algorithms quickly gets difficult because of the number of factors that play into many clinical decisions.</span></div>

                <span class="black-text">It is essential to note that the HapMap Project is no longer the research standard for population genomics as the 1000 Genomes (1KG) project has basically claimed that title. Last year, a security flaw in the legacy HapMap site prompted NCBI to take it down. Usage of the HapMap dataset has declined as 1KG increased in popularity. This website still mentions the HapMap because it was clearly the groundwork of a complete haploytypic map of the human genome.

                <span class="black-text">Personalized Medicine is an older term for precision medicine. It essentially means the same thing - the developement of treatments tailored to the characteristics of an individual patient. But the National Research Council prefers the term precision medicine to personalized medicine because the "personalized medicine" could be misunderstood to mean the creating of drugs that are unique to the patient.
