            <h5>After sufficient personal investigation which included interviewing professionals in the fields of medicine and technology, I firmly believe that machine learning will significantly enhance predictive and precision medicine. As a result, I created this website because I want more people to understand that although predictive and precision medicine may have their limitations, they can still be enormously beneficial to our society. This site is geared towards highschoolers interested in the field of medicine. I believe that if we realize that machine learning has the potential to become an essential tool in the medical field, we can eventually save thousands of lives around the world. I hope that you, the reader, will gain a greater understanding of how machine learning, big data, and the Internet of Things are impacting the field of medicine today.</h5>
