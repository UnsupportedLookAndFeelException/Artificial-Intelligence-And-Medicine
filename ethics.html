              <p>A study conducted by TrapX Labs has recently found that the number of major cyberattacks on healthcare increased by 63% last year. Another study conducted last year by Solutionary discovered healthcare is the most targeted industry by hackers. This obviously stems from the lucrativeness and potential misuses of medical data. Cyberattacks have always been a problem for the healthcare industry although certain legal gudelines have been drawn up to increase cybersecurity. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) included a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act#Security_Rule">security rule</a> issued in 2003. This rule requires Protected Health Information (PHI) to undergo encryption, authentication, and double-keying when transmitted electronically.</p>

              <p>Some people are not just concerned by the possible insecurity of their medical records but also by the fact that law enforcement could look specifically at their personal health information. Many people think that law enforcement should be allowed to investigate somebody's health records if they have a reasonable amount of evidence to suspect the person of being a criminal. Otherwise, citizens should have a right to demand their privacy. Health records contain sensitive data and we should be careful how we use them.</p>

              <span class="card-title">International Sharing</span>
              <p>As big data is being used to make more accurate prediction regarding patients, several issues arise when technology is used to tackle rarer diseases. Some rare diseases are more widespread in certain countries than others. In order for algorithms to be able to make more nearly precise predictions, they need large amounts of data. Whether or not data should be shared from one country to another country is debatable. For instance, if a rare disease breaks out in North Korea, Russia, or Iran, scientists there may not have enough data to be able to treat the disease. The US, on the other hand, has a wealth of big data especially in the medical field. It could definitely leverage this to peacefully negotiate deals with other countries. Other countries – possibly allies of the US – will call this unfair and inhumane. But in the long run, it can avert worse scenarios by valuing diplomacy over war.</p>

              <span class="card-title">Inter-company Sharing</span>
              <p>Other issues could arise within countries when individual companies monopolize over data and choose to give exclusive rights to it for high prices. Should the government place regulations over how medical data is shared or should it allow corporations to hold exclusive rights to data? If corporations share the data, startups will be able to develop ML algorithms faster with larger data sets. As a result, predictive algorithms will become even more accurate and labs working on such algorithms will be able to conduct more research without needing as much government funding. However, all businesses having access to health records presents numerous security issues. First of all, some government agency will have to take certain measures to ensure the data isn’t being misused by a company that falsely claims to be doing research. Second, an agency will have to evaluate the cybersecurity of companies accessing the data. If a company has a low level of security, the risk of its health records being compromised remains the same but the consequences would have an enormous impact on essentially every other research firm that was using the data. If research firms were allowed to maintain exclusive ownership of their own medical records, they would have a greater incentive to develop new products because they would receive all the monetary compensation. Today, hospitals don’t share data with each other because of the afore-mentioned security reasons but one can’t help wondering how much more accurate predictive and precision medicine could be if all data were shared.</p>
